# color-selection
This program opens a window where you can click on different parts of three bars. Each bar has a different color: red, green or blue. You can combine the intensity of each color to change the color of the circle on the screen.

This program was made with SFML, and it is by no means intended to commercial, professional, or any sort of 'serious' use, as my only goal while creating it was to use the experience to learn more about SFML and programming in general. If you want, feel free to use the code of this program in your projects, but I highly recommend for you to at least optimize it in some areas that certainly are lacking.

That's all, thanks for reading.
